This directory contains headers for the CORE sections of the VProc system.
CORE means they are *only* included by the CORE section to which it was
ment for.  Implementors and modules writers should use the headers in the
root src directory.  Core sections interfacing other core sections should
use the headers in the "internal" directory.

CORE headers are included by pre-defining __NEED_${UNIT}_CORE__
...where ${UNIT} is the name of the vproc unit, for example:
#define __NEED_VPROC_MM_CORE__
...would include 'include/core/vproc_mm_core.h' from 'include/vproc.h'
