This directory contains internal code and headers for VProc.
Internal means outside the scope of module writers and implementors...
Just internal to the VProc system.

SYS headers are included by pre-defining __NEED_${UNIT}_SYS__
...where ${UNIT} is the name of the vproc unit, for example:
#define __NEED_VPROC_MM_SYS__
...would include 'include/sys/vproc_mm_sys.h' from 'include/vproc.h'
